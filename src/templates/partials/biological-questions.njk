                    <p>Single-cell mRNA-sequencing empowers researchers to gain
                    unprecedented insight into the cellular heterogeneity of complex biological systems.
                    However, almost all
                    pipelines fail to take advantage of the full power of the
                    technology.</p>
                    <p>The Biomage Single-cell Pipeline makes it possible to analyze
                    your data sets on the level of the individual mRNA molecules
                    identified by the sequencer: in bulk, for each read, or on a cell-by-cell basis.</p>
                    <p>This level of detail means we are able to analyze biological
                    signals that are missed by other commercial products, such as polyadenylation,
                    alternative splicing, RNA velocity, RNA editing, and much more.
                    We take away technical difficulties and bring answers to your deep biological questions. </p>
